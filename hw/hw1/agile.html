                <strong>Agile software development</strong> focuses on reducing waste and unnecessary actions by 
                programmers by valuing <strong>adaptation over prediction</strong>, <strong>code over 
                documentation</strong>, and <strong>iteration over planning</strong>. The philosophy in agile 
                development is to allow for as much flexibility in the design process as possible by minimizing 
                planning and then implementing pieces of a product in small, incremental stages. Unlike in the 
                <a href="waterfall.html">waterfall</a> model, the different stages of are small and tested 
                immediately after each iteration, rather than being tested in a separate step. Each stage of the 
                process is expected to be repeated many times in order to maximize flexibility. These features 
                emphasize getting a minimum product working quickly rather than spending more time planning a 
                project at its start and then rigidly following through on that plan.

                <h2>Advantages</h2> <br />
                Proponents of the agile model stress the model's adaptability and emphasis on building a minimally 
                working part of a project quickly rather than being committed to a plan that may not meet the final 
                needs of a client. A key advantage of agile development is prioritizing delivering continuous, 
                updated code and an ability to respond effectively in changing requirements, even late in the 
                development of a project. As an essential part of attaining these qualities, face-to-face communication 
                both betweeen business people and developers and between co-working peers is strongly encouraged.

                <h2>Criticisms</h2> <br />
                Despite the many advantages of agile devlopment, the practice has encountered a number of critical pitfalls. 
                Most of these pitfalls revolve around crucial management and planning problems, such as assigning tasks 
                inefficiently, poorly trained devlopers spending too much time trying to plan out every possible problem before 
                starting to code, idle team members taking on distracting work not originally delegated to them, developer 
                burnout from agile's quick pace, and problems with management trying to fill multiple roles. These pitfalls 
                can be avoided, but are common enough to warrant significant attention.
