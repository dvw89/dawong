                A <strong>software development life cycle (SDLC)</strong> (also known as an <strong>application development life cycle</strong>, also known as a <strong>systems 
                development life cycle</strong>) is a term used in software engineering, systems engineering, and information systems to describe the a process of planning, creating, testing, and finally deploying software. Although 
                it is possible to break the process down into distinct general stages, (as the diagram at left shows) there are many varying models of SDLCs. Thus, there are many different methodologies used for planning and creating
                functional software. In this brief overview of SDLCs in general, we will examine four distinct models of SDLC commonly in use at present: the <a href="agile.html">agile</a>, 
                <a href="lean.html">lean</a>, <a href="iterative.html">iterative</a>, and <a href="waterfall.html">waterfall</a> models.

                This website was made by David Victor Wong, a student at California State University, solely for the purpose of completing a class assignment. The new HTML tags used in 
                this assignment are the "em" and "blockquote" tags used in the webpage on lean software development. The new CSS properies used in this website are the "background-image" 
                and "background-attachment" properties in the "body" tags of all these webpages to create the matrix-themed background image in these webpages.
