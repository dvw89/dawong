                <strong>Iterative and incremental development</strong> focuses on devloping a program through repeated cycles 
                (iterations) broken into smaller portions (increments), allowing programmers to learn from earlier stages of 
                development and use of the software. This model was created mostly to address the inefficiencies in the 
                <a href="waterfall.html">waterfall</a> model of development.

                <h2>Contrasts with the waterfall model</h2>
                Instead of having the customer involved in only one stage of the development (namely the planning stage), 
                iterative development encourages the customer to continually review the progress on the program after each 
                cycle, increasing the developers' understanding of what the customer wants while also allowing the developers 
                to learn more after each cycle. Also, less manpower is needed than with the <a href="waterfall.html">waterfall
                </a> model. Another advantage is that the user is presented with a fundamental working project much faster 
                than with <a href="waterfall.html">waterfall</a>.
