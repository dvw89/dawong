                The <strong>lean software development model</strong> is based on seven heuristics that prioritize the elimination of waste and the maximizing 
                of efficiency. The seven principles are <strong>eliminate waste</strong>, <strong>amplify learning</strong>, <storng>decide as late as 
                possible</strong>, <strong>deliver as fast as possible</strong>, <strong>empower the team</strong>, <strong>build integriy in</strong>, and 
                <strong>see the whole</strong>.

                <h2>Eliminate waste</h2> <br />
                Examples of waste include: 1) partially done work 2) extra processes 3) extra features 4) task switching 5) Waiting 6) Motion 7) Defects 
                and 8) management activities. The Wikipedia entry for lean software development has this to say
                <blockquote>"In order to eliminate waste, one should be able to recognize it. If some activity could be bypassed or the result could be 
                achieved without it, it is waste. Partially done coding eventually abandoned during the development process is waste. Extra processes 
                like paperwork and features not often used by customers are waste. Switching people between tasks is waste. Waiting for other activities, 
                teams, processes is waste. Motion required to complete work is waste. Defects and lower quality are waste. Managerial overhead not producing 
                real value is waste."</blockquote>

                <h2>Amplify learning</h2> <br />
                The lean development model states that software development is a process that requires constant learning based on many iterations of the same 
                code. The lean model thus encourages devlopers to deemphasize detailed planning and instead create small portions of code that can be quickly 
                built and then immediately tested.  This helps to promote learning through failure and also cathces potential bugs early on in the development 
                process. Short iteration cycles and consistent feedback with customer representatives help to keep a project continuously evolving and both 
                catching errors and clarifying the (potentially changing) requirements of a customer.

            <div>
                <h2>Decide as late as possible</h2> <br />
                Software development always involves a certain amount of uncertainty, so the lean model dictates that decisions should be delayed for <em>as long 
                as possible </em>while a project is being built so that such decisions can be built upon discovered facts rather than on predictions and assumptions. 
                When decisions are delayed in this manner, it can also promote the catching of bugs earlier that would be tremendously expensive if they went 
                undetected until later in the development process. This principle of delayed decisions also allows for more freedom for the customer to better 
                realize their needs and give specifications for their software.

            <div>
                <h2>Deliver as fast as possible</h2> <br />
                Delivering a working iteration of some software without major defects to the customer allows for quicker feedback from the customer about what 
                should be included in the next iteration of the design. The quicker an iteration is completed, the sooner feedback can be given and the sooner 
                the overall project can be completed. The lean model thus stresses delivering complete iterations of software for the client's inspection as 
                soon as possible.

            <div>
                <h2>Empower the team</h2> <br />
                This is a principle involving how to manage developers. Contrary to convention, lean programming encourages managers to <em>let developers "do their 
                own jobs" </em>- in other words, managers should not micro-manage their workers and instead make helpful suggestions for improvements after listening 
                carefully to each developer's concerns. The lean model also discourages thinking of peope as resources and instead stresses the importance of 
                giving individual employees an achievable purpose along with more input about the tasks they will take on. Developers should be able to directly 
                communicate with the customer in order to better tailor their work to the customer's overall needs.

            <div>
                <h2>Build integrity in</h2> <br />
                Conceptual integrity is a term for how well as system's components work together as a whole while allowing for flexibility, maintainability, 
                efficiency, and responsiveness. Since this is a definite advantage in software design, lean development suggests that building the different 
                components of software simultaneously in different groups might be a better approach for conceptual integriy than building each component 
                sequentially. Lean devlopment also stresses "refactoring" - a process of keeping code simple, clear, and with a minimum number of features 
                even as more features are added to the original code base. Continuous communication with the customer and perpetual automated testing help 
                the project maintain conceptual integrity.

            <div>
                <h2>See the whole</h2> <br />
                Since software is more than the sum of its parts, but also the <em>product of their interactions</em>, developers should consider how smoothly the 
                different parts of a software project mesh with each other. Defects in software, which tend to accumulate during the devlopment process, 
                can be more readily detected and dealt with by breaking tasks into as small components as possible. Often, well-defined relationships 
                between different vendors is much better than short-term profit maximizing. Standardizing different stages of development also helps in 
                the smooth integration of the pieces of the project.
