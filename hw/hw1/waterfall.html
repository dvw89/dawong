                The <strong>waterfall software development model</strong> is the original and most striaghtforward 
                of all the different models covered in this website. Essentially, an entire project is developed by 
                first defining the exact specifications of the software and then proceeding stage by stage from 
                those original specifications without an opportunity for iteration or going back to previous stages 
                in order to create a final product.

                <h2>Different stages</h2>
                There are typically six different stages to waterfall development:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>System and software requirements:</strong> in this stage, the exact specifications 
                    of the project are determined.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> schema, models, and business rules are created.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design:</strong> the software architecture is determined.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coding:</strong> the development, proving, and integration of the software is 
                    performed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> the software is systematically tested and debugged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operations:</strong> the installation, migration, support, and maintenance of 
                    the complete system is carried out.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h2>Criticism</h2>
                One major problem with the waterfall model is that clients may not entirely know what their 
                requirements are before they see an example of working software and thus may need redesign, 
                redevelopment, and retesting not supported by model. Another problem is that this model 
                prevents changing the design of new software, thus trapping a development team in a design 
                that is rife with unforseen problems. For these and similar reasons, the waterfall model is 
                largely shunned by most current major developers.
